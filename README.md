# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

The goal for this project was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. The quiz runs in the browser and was built using DOM manipulation via JavaScript. The quiz features a countdown timer and a high scores list that the user may view at any time and may also input their initials when the quiz ends.
